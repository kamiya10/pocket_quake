# Pocket Quake

Pocket Quake 一個會在地震發生時敲你的實驗程式

所有地震資料皆來自 [ExpTech 探索科技](https://github.com/ExpTechTW)，實際請以中央氣象署的資料為主

Pocket Quake is an experimental app that annoys you when an earthquake is incoming.

All earthquake data is from [ExpTech](https://github.com/ExpTechTW) and can be very unstable when high traffic.

This app is made for people lived in Taiwan, so there will be no earthquake support outside of Taiwan.
